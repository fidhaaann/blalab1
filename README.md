# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Fidhaan Aameer


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Fidhaan Aameer - Toc H Institute of Science & Technology


### Project Description
Blablab is a quirky and entertaining web app that lets you upload an audio clip in either English or Malayalam, automatically detects the spoken language, converts it into text, and runs it through AI to produce a short, witty, Gen-Z slang‚Äìinfused explanation ‚Äî loaded with humor, sarcasm, irony, and a pinch of playful chaos.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)


[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
Sometimes you hear something, but it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ too formal. You need it to sound cool, short, and spicy ‚Äî like how Gen Z would say it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made Blablab: upload your boring audio, and get it back as pure internet slang. Your grandma‚Äôs cooking advice? Now it‚Äôs TikTok-ready.
